# Open Biblical Resources

### A collection of biblical facts and resources for any who may benefit from them.

This repository is meant to provide relevant, impactful, truthful information regarding God, the Creator of All Things, Jesus Christ, His Son, and all of creation. This information is freely provided to ministers, youth workers, church leaders, Christians, and those investigating God for the first time. All are welcome to offer contributions to these collective works.
